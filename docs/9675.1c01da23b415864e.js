by all voters, it will win.\nBut if no option has the approval of all voters, this means there is incomplete consensus.\nTo give all voters the same influence, vodle cannot simply declare the most-approved option the winner.\nInstead, it must follow an approach similar to a green-card lottery then:\none voter is drawn by lot, and an option approved by that voter wins.\nStill, even then the broadest possible consensus is sought: \namong the options approved by the drawn voter, the one with the largest overall approve wins. \n"],["Why should I accept that chance may play a role?","\nvodle uses chance only to make sure everyone has a fair chance of being heard.\nOne can prove mathematically that it is not possible to give all voters the same power without using some amount of chance in some situations.\nYou can make sure that chance does <i>not</i> play a role if you find an option that everyone can approve and give that option at least a rating of 1.\nOn the other hand, chance is an unavoidable ingredient of life. \nEven if a vote tallying rule does not explicitly use chance, the overall decision process always contains chance elements anyway in the real world:\nat what time a decision is sought, what options are on offer, which voter has which information, what the consequences of the options would be \n\u2013 all these questions involve some chance element.\n"],["Why are the ratings not simply summed up?","\nSimply summing up all ratings for an option might sound like a good idea at first, but it would not give every voter a fair chance of influencing the result.\nImagine there are two polar options A and B, with A being favoured by 55% of voters and B by 45%,  \nand assume there is a potential consensus option C that all voters consider almost as good as their favourite option. \nThen one would want C to win, and vodle makes this very likely.<br/>\nBut if instead ratings would simply be summed up, \nthen the 55% A-voters could rate A at 100 and rate B and C at 0. \nThen A would wins for sure, no matter what the ratings of the other 45% are.\nSo those 45% would have no influence on the result at all, and the potential consensus option would not have a chance of winning.<br/>\nWith vodle however, the same \u201cnoncooperative\u201d ratings would guarantee A only a winning probability of 55% rather than 100%\nsince every group of voters can only control a share of the winning probability that equals their share of voters.\nIf C is a potential consensus, those 55% would prefer getting C for sure rather than getting A with only 55% probability and getting B with 45% probability.\nSo with vodle, the 55% would give C a positive rating, and so would the other 45%.\nThis way, both factions avoid the uncertain lottery outcome A or B and rather make C the sure winner.\nOne can even prove using game theory that such ratings form a very strong form of strategic equilibrium when voters are rational.<br/>\nOne can also prove similarly, that when ratings were simply summed up instead, rational voters would never give a rating other than zero or 100 to any option,\nand a majority would always get their will however slight the majority is, so that method would not be much different from plain majority voting.\n"],["Why should I rate <i>at least one</i> option at 100?","\nA rating of 100 does not mean that you are completely happy with that option!\nIt rather means that this option is the best or least bad <i>among those options on offer</i>.\nIf you give no option a rating of 100, it may happen that your vote is wasted since you end up approving no option at all.\nBy giving at least one option a rating of 100, you make sure that you retain control over a fair share of the overall decision power\nand that the share of winning probability that you control does not go to any option that you rate at zero. \n"],["Why should I give <i>more than one</i> option a <i>positive</i> rating?","\nIf everyone gives just one option a positive rating, the winner will be determined by lot \nand every option wins with a probability equal to its approval (in percent of all voters who did not abstain).\nNo potential consensus option would get a chance.\nThis highly random result can be avoided by giving potential consensus options a positive rating as well.\nBy doing so, you indicate that you would agree to transfer the share of winning probability controlled by you\nfrom your favourite option to the consensus option if other voters do so as well. \n"],["Which options should get a positive rating?","\nA
